Program Descriptions:
Part 1 - TotalPrice.py
The program should find the total price of an item given the price and sales tax.
The program should prompt the user for the purchase price of an item and the sales tax rate, it should display the total price of the item.
The user should be able to enter values such as 10.25 for price and 7.5 for sales tax rate.

Part 2 - Quadratic.py
The program should prompt the user for the coefficients a, b, c of a quadratic function.
The program should then calculate and display the roots of the function using the quadratic formula.
For now, only use values that will return a positive discriminate, test a = -1, b = 2, c = 3, you should get x = -1 and x = 3 for answers.
