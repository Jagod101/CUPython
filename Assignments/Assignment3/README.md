Program Descriptions:
```
Part 1 - Sum.py
Write a python program that prompts the user for the how many numbers he/she
would like to sum and then asks the user for each number and displays the sum.

Part 2 - Con_Sum.py
Write a program that prompts for an integer — let’s call it x — and then finds
the sum of x consecutive integers starting at 1. That is, if x = 5, you will find the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

Part 3 - Perfect_Square.py
Write a short program prompts the user for a number, print out
whether the number is a perfect square, and prompts the user for another number if the number was not a perfect square.
A perfect square is a number that has a whole number square root. For example, 25 is a perfect square, because 5, is a whole number.
