Assignment 8 - File and Exception Handling
```
```
Source Files: complement2electricboogaloo.py, test.txt, README.md
Errors: N/A
References: N/A
```
Program Descriptions:
```
This assignment will require you to use your complement.py module from Assignment 6. You NEED NOT CHANGE ANYTHING about the functions (assuming they are correct), you will only be altering your existing python program to add the functionality below.

Now that we have covered files & exception handling, your task is to incorporate both into your module above. The program should read in the needed information from a file and write the results to a file named ‘results_complement.txt’. Keep in mind that multiple lines should be able to be read in and translated as required. The file name to be read from will be provided by the user via an input. You should also incorporate error handling to insure the file name inputted by the user is valid.
